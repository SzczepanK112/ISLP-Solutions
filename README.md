# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python

This repository is dedicated to my own solutions for problem sets contained in the book *"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python"* by ...

The structure of this repo is straightforward: every directory is labeled with the corresponding chapter name and number. Inside each directory, there are typically two Jupyter notebooks. One contains the functionalities explained in the book, and the other contains the proper solutions. Additionally, I might include subdirectories with screenshots from the book, which will be displayed inside the notebooks to familiarize the reader with the problem addressed in the exercise. I also provided .yml file for anyone who wants to recreate my analysis.
